# Changelog

### V2.0.0-pre1

- Changed: Some monitor commands have been renamed or the options have changed. That is the reason for bumping the major version number.
- Added: The --device command line option now accepts '?' and will in response provide the list of supported MCUs.
- Changed: Refactorization of RSP memory read/write.
- Test suite has been set up and development of tests for GdbHandler has been started.
- Fixed: The number generated by the G packet was too large. Now it is first split into bytes. This bug showing up only when executing the test suite probably means that it has not been used since we introduced the P command.
- Fixed: When calling cmd.startswith(inputstring) one must be aware that if inputstring is empty, the return value is True. In the monitor command parsing, I forgot that. 

### V1.3.0 (25-Feb-2025)

- Added: Automatic power-cycling for mEDBG (e.g., Atmega328 XPLAINED)

### V1.2.0 (25-Feb-2025)

- Refactored: Inserting into flash cache and writing pages have been isolated from vFlashWrite and vFlashDone. Now, they can also be used in the  X command.
- Added: X command can now be used when the GDB client does not support XML.

- Added: A new monitor NoXML command for switching off XML capabilities, meaning that we cannot send a memory map and, therefore, cannot make use of the vFlash RSP commands. This command is just there for testing purposes and no "official" monitor command. It will probably go away to some point.

### V1.1.2 (24-Feb-2025)

- Fixed: Crash when stopping with ^C because sendPacket instead of sendSignal was used.

- Fixed: pyusb worked perfectly under macOS and Linux for enumerating all USB devices, but I got nothing under Windows. So, I removed this package because hidapi is doing all the work anyway.

### V1.1.0 (24-Feb-2025)

- Added: Flash verification
- Added: `monitor flashverify [on|off]`
- Changed: `monitor flashcache [on|off]` to `monitor cache [on|off]`
- Changed requirement for Python to >= 3.9

### V1.0.0 (24-Feb-2025)

- First "offical" version, published on PyPi

### V0.9.16 (24-Feb-2025)

- Added: disabled "run timers when stopped" in warmStart to make sure that this indeed the default.
- Restructured project structure to make it an installable packet
- Changed: Version number is now retrieved from importlib.metadata.version

### V0.9.15 (23-FEB-2025)

- Changed: dw-harvest.py moved to deviceinfo/harvest.py
- Added: collect.py script in deviceinfo, which collects which MCUs are supported and what is the device ID/name mapping.
- Added: Early check in main whether device is supported
- Changed: We now use names instead of signatures in the error messages about the wrong MCU.

- Changed: Signals are now numbers, not strings anymore
- Changed: Instead of sending S-packets (containing only signal numbers), we now send T-packets with SREG, SP, and PC. Supposedly, this speeds up the time after a stop.

- Added: `monitor timers [freeze|run]` command implemented.

- Fixed: 'Address in use' errors happened regularly when starting dw-gdbserver after fatal errors. This occurs when the gdbserver closes the IP connection first.  To avoid this, fatal errors are now caught on the level of monitor commands or the general handler, and the server is not terminated. This forces the user to terminate the debugger, after which the gdbserver can wait some time and then terminate, freeing the IP port immediately (see https://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Tech/addrinuse.html)

### V0.9.14 (21-Feb-2025)

- Fixed: Attaching to the AVR core now, because the XPLAINED-Mini board requested it.
- Fixed: XPLAINED-Mini only accepts full-page reads. Now, we either read from the cache or fall back to page-wise reading if there is nothing there.
- Fixed the problem of breakpoints not being removed when finishing.
- Implemented lazy breakpoint handling. 
- Implemented assignment of hardware BPs to the most recently introduced breakpoints. 
- Implemented two-word instruction simulation when starting at a breakpoint
- Implemented interrupt-safe single-stepping (+ the monitor function to enable that: `monitor singlestep safe`)
- Implemented monitor commands to disable fast loading and flash caching: `monitor load writeonly` and `monitor flashcache off` . Default is `readbeforewrite` and on, respectively.
- Implemented monitor commands for internal testing purposes: `monitor LiveTests` will initiate a live test of the gdbserver. Here the full command has to written out!
- Implemented monitor command to selectively switch new execution, single -stepping, and breakpoint handling on and off: `monitor Execution [old|new]`. Default is `old`.
- Renamed classes and modules to x... instead of dwe_ and X... instead of DWE. X standing for 'extended'.
- Tried out the SNAP, and it works without a hitch, albeit a bit slower than Atmel-ICE. Will measure load times with both.

### V0.9.13 (17-Feb-2025)

- Fixed: Learned from xedbg that there exists a field called `buffers_per_flash_block` , which can be used to tell the debugger that the MCU has a 4-page erase command. With that, ATtiny1634, 841, and 441 work now as well!
- Changed: The property `buffers_per_flash_page` as found in the ATDF files is taken as it is and not changed to something else.

### V0.9.12 (16-Feb-2025)

- Refactoring: New `MonitorCommand` class, which does all the bookkeeping and messaging
- Fixed: In the 'S' and 'C' commands, the signal was interpreted as an address 

### V0.9.11 (15-Feb-2025)

- Changed: Cleaned up info messages when starting up
- Changed: Streamlined debug log messages in GDB handler
- Changed: `continue` and `single step` now receive SIGHUP when not connected to debugWIRE 
- Added: S and C record handling is now necessary because GDB propagates signals other than SIGTRAP
- Added: Check for overlapping chunks when flashing
- Fixed: Reading single flash bytes (even at mis-aligned byte addresses) works now.
- Added: `monitor noload`, which allows for execution even if no prior `load` command has been executed

### V0.9.10 (14-Feb-2025)

- Fixed: Before starting the final ISP session in order to unprogram the DWEN fuse, another restart of the tool is performed by housekeeping end_session/start_session. This fixes the problem I observed earlier when the fusebit was not unprogrammed after leaving the debugger.
- Added: In dw-harvest.py, the `OCD` property `BUFFERS_PER_FLASH_PAGE` is evaluated. This seems to be the one that signals that the MCU has a 4-page erase command. I yet have to find a way of not deleting the other 3 pages when writing to one of the pages in a block of 4 pages.

### V0.9.9 (14-Feb-2025)

- Fixed: The packet parsing procedure had ignored the fact that
  single-letter commands can be immediately followed by a hex number;
  now we treat those commands in the right way.

### V0.9.8 (14-Feb-2025)

- Added: `monitor noload` will allow execution even without a previous
  load command. It will be taken as a request to cache the entire
  flash in the debugger.

### V0.9.6 (13-Feb-2025)

- Changed: All debugWIRE relevant start/finish methods have been moved
to dw-gdbserver. The code has been placed into a new class DebugWIRE.

### V0.9.5 (13-Feb-2025)

- Fixed: After enabling debugWIRE by setting the DWEN fuse and power-cycling, the
debugging tool is restarted by a
housekeeper.end\_session()/housekeeper.start\_session() pair.
With that, debugging works now after having just enabled the debugWIRE mode.

### V0.9.4 (13-Feb-2025)
- Much of the startup/shutdown code is now modularized and ready to be
  moved over to dw-gdbserver

### V0.9.3 (13-Feb-2025)
- Changed: power_cycle is now a method. 

### V0.9.2 (11-Feb-2025)

- Apparently, one should not request a reset after connecting. Removing that helped a lot. Well, turned out later that this was a symptom of not restarting the housekeeping session (see V0.9.5).
- MCUs with Stuck-at-1-bits are identified.
- Added code to honor the fact that the ATmega88/168/328 pretend to be P-versions when in debugWIRE mode
- Set the EEARH field in the activation record to EEARl+1. This seems to be the right choice when following the datasheet for the ATmega48. And it led to success in starting the MCU.

### V0.9.1 (11-Feb-2025)

- Works now with ATmega328P
- harvested all debugWIRE MCUs with the new scripâ€št dw-harvest.py
- does not work with ATmega48, and probably not with others ...

### V0.9.0 (8-Feb-2025)

- basic functionality for using it as a gdbserver is implemented
- if already in debugWIRE mode, debugging is started right after `target remote`
- suppressed some spurious error messages from `nvmspi` and `jtagice3protocol` by setting the log level to `CRITICAL` for these modules
- set `pyedglib` log level to `INFO` when general level is `DEBUG`

### V0.0.9 (7-Feb-2025)

- `monitor debugwire on` now first tries ISP and will ask for power-cycle
- if ISP does not work, we switch directly DW on
- `monitor debugwire off`  only works once, but this is OK!
- the device parameter is now tested against DW and ISP targets
- multiple NAKs caused by time-outs waiting for power-cycling are bulk deleted
- implemented a callback function when calling `dbg.setup_session` for notifying in the debug console that a power-cycle is necessary
- Added `dwe_nvmspi.py` in order to suppress the warning message in the initial method

### V0.0.8 (6-Feb-2025)

- check first on whether there are potential debuggers at all and if not, we start dw-link immediately
- checked for each command that dw_mode is active; if not an error reply is given 
- added field `dwen_fuse` to the device description for debugWIRE devices (its always in the high fuse)
- in avrdebug.py, put part of `setup_session`  into `__init__` so that device and memory infos are available before connecting to the device

### V0.0.7 (6-Feb-2025)

- integrated the dw-server script as the slightly rewritten dwlink module; you can now require the tool `dwlink` or it will be tried as the last alternative if no other debuggers are found; the reason for being last is that the discovery process for dw-link can take some time

### V0.0.6 (6-Feb-2025)

- adding support for single register get/set

### V0.0.5 (6-Feb-2005)

- flash programming has been implemented
- now, each memory page is checked before flashing in order to avoid flashing identical contents, speeds up loading from 1kB/sec to 14kB/sec

- rewrote "handleData" so that it is now able to cope with NAKs (which are very unlikely)

### V0.0.4 (2-Feb-2025)

- in extended-remote mode, one stays now in session after a "kill"
  command, and the program can be restarted with "run"
- quit is now done with "detach" (because we reply with "1" to "qAttached"), and it is not possible to re-attach after detaching!
- the server now waits a second after having sent the detach so that
  the client can close first, reducing the likelihood of an "address
  already in use" error
- refactored things again in order to allow for binary payloads (X and
  vFlashWrite)
- each command now has its own handler
- the server now provides a (minimal) memory map in XML format so that GDB uses
  the vFlash commands
- providing the map means, however, that we now have to pretend to use hardware
  breakpoints, because GDB believes that flash memory is read-only

### V0.0.3 (1-Feb-2025)

- extended-remote works now (important when using Gede)
- kill/quit/detach do now the reasonable things
- when starting a load command, at least the packets got interpreted
  the right way; in the original version, the accepted packet size was
  much larger than the read block, which clashed

### V0.0.2 (31-Jan-2025)

- Refactoring of the GdbHandler class. It looks much better now, but the functionality is the same. 

### V0.0.1 (30-Jan-2025)

- Almost all packets are handled. In particular, the load function is not there yet, and there is no support for X-packages.

### V0.0.0-pre1 (24-Jan-2025)

- Setting up the framework by using pyavrdebug (by mraardvark). Identified the modules that need changes in pymcuprog and implemented the first version of modules with specialized classes that I will use. Later on, these could be used to create a PR. I prefixed the module names with dwe_ (standing for debugWIRE enabled) and the classes with DWE:
  - dwe_avr8target.py
  - dwe_avrdebug.py
  - dwe_nvmdebugwire.py

- In addition, I prepared a new deviceinfo/devices folder, which will be populated with all the devices that will be supported.
